Assignment for CI6226 Information Retrieval &amp; Analysis.

### Abstract

Information retrieval plays a huge role in our every day life. We would always like to search for information that we care about or want to know using search engines like Google, Baidu, Bing and so on. And there are always new friends, movies or products that applications we use like Twitter, Youtube or eBay recommends to us. These services are all based on information retrieval. In a certain point, human beings are hard to live without information retrieval in an information era.
Stack Overflow is a Q&A website which allows programmers to search, ask, answer and make comments on questions. And our project aims to provide a search engine system to let user quickly search for their questions based on part of the Stack Overflow data. We also built another two applications to analysis the data. One application is to retrieve the popularity of each programming language from 2008 to 2016. The other application is to rank users based on their answer counts.
This report demonstrates the whole project lifecycle of the search engine and the two IR applications. The project lifecycle includes system architecture design, development of the search engine and the IR applications, user interface design and its implementation and the evaluation of the search engine.
